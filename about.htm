		In 1986 we had our 4th child and needed a bigger car. My father-in-law who was a retired sears service manager was doing tub repairs as a part time job.
		He said, "Come work with me so you can make enough to buy a van!" I liked the idea of working around my kids schedules. After training and working for him
		for 6 months he let me know he was totally retiring and I now had a <p> business! I worked hard to learn to do more in the different finishes and kept building my
		company for warranty work. In 1999 my husband's job was laying off many employees and moving out of town so we decided to make it a total family business. We have been
		together since then and love every minute of it!

		Testimonial
 		</p>
		<p>
		Wickham's Repair Service are the go to people for tub restoration. I have 2 tub/shower units that were cracked in the floor. I was referred to <p><p><p><p><p>
		Wickham's and they have done great work! The restoration has enabled us to fix, saving us lots of money and time, rather than replace units.
